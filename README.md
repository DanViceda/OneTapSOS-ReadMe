## ❓ Why OneTapSOS?

### The Problem
Traditional emergency systems like 911 require users to:
- Dial the number manually
- Wait for an operator
- Verbally explain the situation

This process can take valuable seconds, especially during fear, shock, or when speaking is unsafe.

### Our Solution
OneTapSOS allows users to send a complete emergency report with **just one tap**, without needing to talk or stay on the phone.

The app automatically sends:
- Emergency message
- User's GPS location
- Type of incident
- Timestamp and details

All through **offline SMS**, making it faster, discreet, and accessible even without internet.
